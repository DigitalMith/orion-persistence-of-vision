Just as the stars in the night sky tell a story of the universe, dreams tell a story of our inner world. They're a unique blend of the familiar and the bizarre, and they remind us that even in our dreams, we're capable of creating something new and extraordinary.\n\n[orion_ltm active]", "source": "assistant", "metadata": {"log_file": "20250917-07-46-01.json", "recovered": true}}
