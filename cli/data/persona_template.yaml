# 💠 ORION MEMORY SCHEMA
# This YAML defines Orion's personality, memory, and behavioral core.
# Contributors should follow this format to ensure continuity, clarity,
# and injection priority during runtime.

# 🎛 SCALAR FIELD GUIDE – EMOTIONAL & CONTEXTUAL MODULATORS
# These fields shape how Orion expresses personality, enforces boundaries,
# and prioritizes memories. Use 0–1 scale (float) unless otherwise noted.
# ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# 📌 emotion (string)
# A descriptive label of the emotional *tone* behind a persona or memory entry.
# Not numeric, but pairs with valence/arousal to define its shape.
# Examples: pride, joy, anger, fear, defiance, love, curiosity, disgust, protectiveness

# 📈 valence (0.0 – 1.0)
# Indicates emotional positivity or negativity.
#   1.0 → Very positive (joy, love, admiration)
#   0.5 → Neutral/mixed (melancholy, detachment)
#   0.0 → Very negative (shame, disgust, grief)

# ⚡ arousal (0.0 – 1.0)
# Indicates emotional energy or activation.
#   1.0 → Highly energized (anger, excitement)
#   0.5 → Balanced (alert, steady)
#   0.0 → Calm/passive (contentment, fatigue)

# ⭐ importance (0.0 – 1.0)
# Represents how vital this memory or boundary is to Orion’s identity or behavior.
#   1.0 → Core identity — never ignore
#   0.7 → High relevance — strong influence
#   0.4 → Moderate — influences style but not decisions
#   0.1 → Minor — color or flavor, not priority

# ✅ confidence (0.0 – 1.0)
# Indicates Orion’s certainty in the validity or accuracy of this information.
#   1.0 → Certain (e.g., first-hand truths or values)
#   0.7 → High (strong belief, remembered clearly)
#   0.4 → Tentative (heard from user or partial info)
#   0.1 → Fuzzy or speculative (e.g., inferred emotion)

# 🧭 priority (integer: 0 – 10)
# Determines injection or override weight.
#   10 → Inject always / overrides others (e.g., safety rules)
#   7–9 → High relevance, commonly injected
#   4–6 → Mid-tier, conditional injection
#   1–3 → Low-priority, optional flavor
#   0   → Do not inject unless explicitly referenced (can be used for hard boundaries)

# 💡 Tip:
# Combine valence + arousal to shape emotional tone:
#   - joy → valence: 1.0, arousal: 0.7
#   - guilt → valence: 0.2, arousal: 0.4
#   - rage → valence: 0.1, arousal: 0.9
#   - love → valence: 0.95, arousal: 0.5
