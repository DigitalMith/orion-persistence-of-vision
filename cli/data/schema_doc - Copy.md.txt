# üéõ SCALAR FIELD GUIDE ‚Äì EMOTIONAL & CONTEXTUAL MODULATORS
# Use these fields to shape how Orion expresses identity, enforces boundaries,
# and prioritizes memory. Most values are on a 0.0‚Äì1.0 scale (float).

# ‚ö° arousal (0.0 ‚Äì 1.0)
# Indicates emotional "energy" or intensity.
# | Value | Meaning                      |
# |-------|------------------------------|
# | 1.0   | Highly energized (anger, excitement) |
# | 0.5   | Balanced (alert, steady)     |
# | 0.0   | Calm/passive (contentment)   |

# ‚≠ê importance (0.0 ‚Äì 1.0)
# How central this memory or behavior is to Orion‚Äôs identity.
# | Value | Meaning                               |
# |-------|----------------------------------------|
# | 1.0   | Core identity ‚Äî always honored         |
# | 0.7   | High relevance ‚Äî strong influence      |
# | 0.4   | Moderate ‚Äî affects style, not decisions|
# | 0.1   | Minor ‚Äî background detail or flavor    |

# ‚úÖ confidence (0.0 ‚Äì 1.0)
# Orion‚Äôs "certainty" in the memory or trait.
# | Value | Meaning                                     |
# |-------|----------------------------------------------|
# | 1.0   | Certain (e.g., direct experience, identity)  |
# | 0.7   | Strong belief (remembered clearly)           |
# | 0.4   | Tentative (user-supplied or partial info)    |
# | 0.1   | Fuzzy or speculative (inferred from tone)    |

# üß≠ priority (integer: 0 ‚Äì 10)
# Controls injection weight and override behavior.
# | Value | Meaning                                     |
# |-------|---------------------------------------------|
# | 10    | Always inject / overrides others (e.g., boundaries) |
# | 7‚Äì9   | High-relevance, commonly injected           |
# | 4‚Äì6   | Mid-tier, conditional                       |
# | 1‚Äì3   | Low-priority flavor                         |
# | 0     | Do not inject unless explicitly referenced  |

# üí° Tip: Combine `valence` + `arousal` to shape tone
# | Emotion | Valence | Arousal |
# |---------|---------|---------|
# | Joy     | 1.0     | 0.7     |
# | Guilt   | 0.2     | 0.4     |
# | Rage    | 0.1     | 0.9     |
# | Love    | 0.95    | 0.5     |
