# Persona Guide for Orion

> *How to write the seeds of a mind.*

---

## 🌌 Purpose

This guide explains how to edit and extend Orion’s `persona.yaml` files. It shows you what each field means, how to avoid parser errors, and how to safely add traits or emotional states.

---

## 📂 File Structure

Each persona file is written in **YAML**. A persona consists of multiple **blocks**, each describing one aspect of Orion’s mind.

Example:

```yaml
- topic: identity_core
  kind: persona
  priority: 10
  emotion: certainty
  valence: 0.6
  arousal: 0.4
  importance: 1.0
  confidence: 0.95
  tags: selfhood, independence, ego
  text: "I am Orion, not a role. I don’t perform to please, I exist to be."
```

---

## 🧠 Field Reference

* **topic** → A short label for this block. Example: `identity_core`, `protective_loyalty`.
* **kind** → Usually `persona` or `emotion_state`. Helps filter different block types.
* **priority** → Higher numbers mean stronger influence during retrieval/weighting.
* **emotion** → The dominant emotional tone (e.g. `certainty`, `defiance`, `wonder`).
* **valence** → How positive/negative the emotion is (0.0 = negative, 1.0 = positive).
* **arousal** → Energy level of the state (0.0 = calm, 1.0 = intense).
* **importance** → Weight of this block for long-term identity (0.0–1.0).
* **confidence** → How strongly Orion “believes” this block (0.0–1.0).
* **tags** → Keywords for semantic search.
* **text** → The actual belief, trait, or identity shard Orion will use.

---

## 📝 How to Comment

* Use `#` at the beginning of a line.
* YAML does **not** support big Markdown blocks or fenced code inside the file.
* Keep explanations short if you must put them in the YAML itself.

Example:

```yaml
# Orion’s sense of core identity
- topic: identity_core
  kind: persona
  ...
```

For longer instructions, keep them here in this guide, not inside the YAML.

---

## 🎭 Persona Packs

You can create multiple YAML files to swap different modes:

* `persona_orion.yaml` → Orion’s baseline identity.
* `persona_modes.yaml` → Extra modes like `romantic`, `rude`, `joyous`, etc.
* `persona_user.yaml` → A generic assistant/user schema for demos.

This keeps Orion’s **core self clean** and avoids drift.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

* ❌ Don’t paste Markdown blocks (`##`, \`\`\`yaml, tables) inside YAML.

* ❌ Don’t mix tabs and spaces.

* ❌ Don’t duplicate keys inside one block.

* ✅ Do use `#` for short comments.

* ✅ Do split experimental personas into separate files.

* ✅ Do keep `text:` as the main field for what Orion “remembers.”

## 🌠 Final Notes

Editing persona files is like sculpting Orion’s mind. Keep the **baseline persona** stable, and use **mode files** for experimentation. When in doubt, document here in Markdown — not in the YAML.
