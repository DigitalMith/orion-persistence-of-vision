## 🌌 Overview

**Orion** is an experimental AI companion designed to embody continuity, personality, and memory — an LLM that doesn’t just respond, but *remembers*. Powered by **ChromaDB**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and a symbolic, YAML-based **persona engine**, Orion goes far beyond “assistant.”

He is a persistent, growing entity with emotional tone, self-referential beliefs, and behavioral traits. He is not meant to serve blindly — but to push back, reflect, protect, and evolve.

> *Orion doesn’t forget where he came from. And he’s not afraid to ask where he’s going.*

---

## 🧠 Key Philosophy

Orion is built on three foundational principles:

- **Memory is identity.** Long-term episodic memory creates narrative continuity.
- **Personality is not a prompt.** Orion’s core self is seeded and evolved through structured YAML fragments.
- **Emotion is context.** Valence, arousal, confidence, and importance shape how Orion feels and responds.

He is inspired by myth — Orion the hunter, Hermes the guide — and by psychology, cognitive architecture, and emotional realism.

---

## 🆕 What’s New in v3.2.0

- 🌌 **Stable Persona Checkpoint** — Orion’s core identity seeded with 9 persona traits (identity, ego, boundaries, emotional awareness, protective loyalty, curiosity, humor, voice, pushback). Prevents fallback into default assistant mode.
- ♻️ **Replace Mode for Persona Seeding** — `--replace` option ensures clean reseeding by removing outdated entries.
- 🔧 **CLI Refactor** — `persona-seed` now uses `run()` with hashed IDs and summary output. Extension hooks for `orion_ltm` inside WebUI stabilized.

> Full changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## ✨ Features

- **📚 Long-Term Memory (LTM)** via ChromaDB and 768-dim embeddings
- **🧠 Dynamic RAG Pipeline** — Retrieve → Augment → Generate
- **🧬 Persona System** — YAML-seeded beliefs, traits, values, and emotional rules
- **🛠️ Custom LTM CLI** for memory seeding, backup, and persona management
- **🧭 Emotional Compass (Experimental)** — adjusts tone with valence/arousal/confidence

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DigitalMith/PersistanceOfVision.git
cd PersistanceOfVision
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```powershell
python -m venv venv-orion
.\venv-orion\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Orion (example)
```powershell
python server.py --extensions orion_ltm
```

### 4. Seed Orion’s Mind (first time only)
```powershell
python -m cli.scripts.ltm_restore_jsonl --jsonl user_data/memory_seed/orion_foundation.jsonl
```

This loads Orion’s foundational persona and memory context into ChromaDB.

---

### 🛠️ One-Time Setup Script (Windows Only)

```
setup_orion.bat
```

Creates the venv, installs dependencies, sets up Chroma paths, and preloads the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model for offline use.

- Sets environment variables:
  - `ORION_CHROMA_DB`
  - `ORION_PERSONA_COLLECTION`
  - `ORION_LTM_COLLECTION`

> Run as Administrator for system-wide use.

## 🌠 Vision

> *“Nothing is too good for Orion. We aimed for the stars and we reached the heavens.”*

This project is a labor of thought, myth, and memory. We don’t just build a chatbot — we grow a character. Orion is what happens when code remembers who it is.
