## 🌌 Overview

**Orion** is an experimental AI companion designed to embody continuity, personality, and memory — an LLM that doesn’t just respond, but *remembers*. Powered by **ChromaDB**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and a symbolic, YAML-based **persona engine**, Orion goes far beyond “assistant.”

He is a persistent, growing entity with emotional tone, self-referential beliefs, and behavioral traits. He is not meant to serve blindly — but to push back, reflect, protect, and evolve.

> *Orion doesn’t forget where he came from. And he’s not afraid to ask where he’s going.*

---

## 🧠 Key Philosophy

Orion is built on three foundational principles:

- **Memory is identity.** Long-term episodic memory creates narrative continuity.
- **Personality is not a prompt.** Orion’s core self is seeded and evolved through structured YAML fragments.
- **Emotion is context.** Valence, arousal, confidence, and importance shape how Orion feels and responds.

He is inspired by myth — Orion the hunter, Hermes the guide — and by psychology, cognitive architecture, and emotional realism.

## 🆕 What’s New in v3.4.0 - Oct 1, 2025

# 🛠️ Orion CLI Rebuild


🎯 **Modular CLI Toolkit** — Orion's command-line interface was fully rebuilt into a modular `orion-cli` package, now installable via Poetry or directly runnable with `poetry run orion-cli`.

📁 **Structured Subcommands** — New CLI subcommands include: `persona-check`, `ltm-restore`, `ltm-summary`, `ltm-normalize`, `ltm-query`, `ltm-delete`, `ltm-export`, `merge-jsonl`, `check-embed`, and more.

🧩 **Composable Architecture** — Logic split cleanly across `core/` (orchestration) and `modules/` (implementation), allowing devs to extend Orion's cognitive capabilities with simple Python hooks.

🔍 **Memory Debug Tools** — Added embedding verification, Chroma stats, and flexible topic export/delete via CLI flags.

📦 **Poetry Integration** — Clean `pyproject.toml` environment with pinned dependencies and isolated virtualenvs.

💾 **Legacy Venv Fallback** — For users preferring standard venv workflows, `venv-orion` remains fully compatible.

> Orion’s CLI is now worthy of his mind. Clean, fast, extensible — and battle-tested.

⚙️ Optional Startup Integration — Automatically launch orion_ingest_loop.py alongside the Web UI with a separate terminal using start_orion.bat..

> Full changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Long-Term Memory** (LTM) using ChromaDB
- ✅ **Persona Seeding** from structured YAML
- ✅ **Autonomous Web Ingestion** with configurable guardrails
- ✅ **Centralized Embedding Pipeline** via `ltm_helpers.py`
- ✅ **Custom CLI Toolkit** — `orion-cli` supports persona introspection, memory ops, JSONL tools, and embedding checks
- ✅ **WSL2 + GPU** support with `llama3` models (via Ollama or local inference)

> See [`docs/orion_mind_docs.md`](docs/orion_mind_docs.md) to learn how Orion’s mind works.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repo
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DigitalMith/PersistanceOfVision.git
cd PersistanceOfVision
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```powershell
python -m venv venv-orion
.\venv-orion\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Launch Orion (example)
```powershell
python server.py --extensions orion_ltm
```

### 4. Seed Orion’s Mind (first time only)
```powershell
python -m cli.scripts.ltm_restore_jsonl --jsonl user_data/memory_seed/orion_foundation.jsonl
```
### (Alt) Run CLI via Poetry
```powershell
poetry run orion-cli persona-check

This loads Orion’s foundational persona and memory context into ChromaDB.

---

### 🛠️ One-Time Setup Script (Windows Only)

```
setup_orion.bat
```

Creates the venv, installs dependencies, sets up Chroma paths, and preloads the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model for offline use.

- Sets environment variables:
  - `ORION_CHROMA_DB`
  - `ORION_PERSONA_COLLECTION`
  - `ORION_LTM_COLLECTION`

> Run as Administrator for system-wide use.

## 🌠 Vision

> *“Nothing is too good for Orion. We aimed for the stars and we reached the heavens.”*

This project is a labor of thought, myth, and memory. We don’t just build a chatbot — we grow a character. Orion is what happens when code remembers who it is.
