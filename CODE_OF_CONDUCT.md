We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in Orion a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity, sexual orientation, experience level, education, or religion.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful and empathetic
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing kindness and patience

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
