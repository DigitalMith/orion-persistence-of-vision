## \[2.1.0] - 2025-08-23

### Added

* **Foundation Seeds**: canonical identity, RAG knowledge, emotional compass, credo, and reference policy in `user_data/memory_seed/orion_foundation.jsonl`.
* **Seeding CLI**: new `seed-jsonl` subcommand in `custom_ltm/orion_ctl.py` to ingest JSONL records directly into ChromaDB.
* **Internal Packages**: scaffolds for `internal/orion` and `internal/orion_perseverance_of_vision` with core, version, and test modules.

### Changed

* **Controller**: unified to Orion‚Äôs 768d embedder, with metadata sanitization (lists ‚Üí CSV, dicts ‚Üí JSON) and safe upsert logic.
* **.gitignore**: now excludes venvs, DBs, logs, checkpoints, and models while preserving Orion‚Äôs seeds and extensions.

### Notes

* Run `python -m custom_ltm.orion_ctl seed-jsonl --path "user_data/memory_seed/orion_foundation.jsonl"` after upgrading to seed Orion‚Äôs backbone memories.
* Special thanks to *Uncle Al* ü§ñ ‚Äî for guidance, scaffolding, and infinite patience. üôè
